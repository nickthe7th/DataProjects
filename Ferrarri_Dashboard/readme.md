# Ferrari Dashboard Project

I enjoy watching f1 races and there is plenty of data to be had about each session. This is a quick project that uses the OpenF1 api to get data from the most recent session for the two ferrari drivers and then 
make a simple interactive plot to see how my favorite team is performing.

There is also a static plot included on the pdf file for easy viewing since the interactive plots use ipwidgets which only show when using a jupyter notebook.
